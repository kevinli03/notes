# Question 1

Find the mixed strategy equilibria of the following static games:

## 1a:

|     |          |          |
|-----|----------|----------|
|     | L        | R        |
| T   | 1, **2** | **2**, 0 |
| B   | **2**, 1 | 0, **3** |

We can pretty quickly see there are no Nash Equilibria. Now, let us define $p$ and $q$ as the following:

-   $p$ is probability player 1 plays $T$, $1-p$ is probability plays $B$. Let us call this strategy $\sigma_1$.

-   $q$ is probability player 2 plays $L$, $1-q$ is probability plays $R$ . Let us call this strategy $\sigma_2$.

-   $\sigma_i(s_k)$ denotes the probability that player $i$ plays strategy $s_k$

What are **player 1's** expected utilities when playing either strategy?

-   $u_1 (T, \sigma_2) = \sigma_2(s_L)u_1(T, L) + \sigma_2(S_R) u_1(T, R) = (q)1 + (1-q)2$

-   $u_1 (B, \sigma_2) = \sigma_2(s_L) u_1(B,L) + \sigma_2(s_R) u_1(B,R)  = (q)2 + (1-q)0$

For mixed strategy equilibrium to exist, by definition, players must be indifferent to both strategies:

$$
\begin{split}
u_1 (T, \sigma_2) & = u_1 (B, \sigma_2) \\
(q)1 + (1-q)2 & = (q)2 + (1-q)0 \\
q + 2 - 2q & = 2q \\
-q + 2 & = 2q \\
3q & = 2 \\
q & = 2/3
\end{split}
$$

What are **player 2's** expected utilities when playing either strategy?

-   $u_2( \sigma_1, L) = \sigma_1(s_T)u_2(T, L) + \sigma_1(s_B)u_2(B, L) = (p)2 + (1-p)1$

-   $u_2(\sigma_1, R) = \sigma_1(s_T)u_2(T, R) + \sigma_1(s_B)u_2(B, R) = (p)0 + (1-p)3$

For mixed strategy equilibrium to exist, by definition, players must be indifferent to both strategies:

$$
\begin{split}
u_2(\sigma_1, L) & = u_2(\sigma_1, R) \\
(p)2 + (1-p)1 & = (p)0 + (1-p)3 \\
2p + 1 - p & = 3 - 3p \\
p + 1 & = 3 - 3p \\
4p & = 2 \\
p & = 1/2
\end{split}
$$

Thus, there is a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibria where:

$$
(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*) = \left((\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} ), (\frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3} ) \right)
$$

## 1b:

|     |          |          |
|-----|----------|----------|
|     | L        | R        |
| T   | **6**, 0 | 0, **6** |
| B   | 3, **4** | **6**, 0 |

We can pretty quickly see there are no Nash Equilibria. Now, let us define $p$ and $q$ as the following:

-   $p$ is probability player 1 plays $T$, $1-p$ is probability plays $B$. Let us call this strategy $\sigma_1$.

-   $q$ is probability player 2 plays $L$, $1-q$ is probability plays $R$ . Let us call this strategy $\sigma_2$.

-   $\sigma_i(s_k)$ denotes the probability that player $i$ plays strategy $s_k$

What are **player 1's** expected utilities when playing either strategy?

-   $u_1 (T, \sigma_2) = \sigma_2(s_L)u_1(T, L) + \sigma_2(S_R) u_1(T, R) = (q)6 + (1-q)0$

-   $u_1 (B, \sigma_2) = \sigma_2(s_L) u_1(B,L) + \sigma_2(s_R) u_1(B,R) = (q)3 + (1-q)6$

For mixed strategy equilibrium to exist, by definition, players must be indifferent to both strategies:

$$
\begin{split}
u_1 (T, \sigma_2) & = u_1 (B, \sigma_2) \\
(q)6 + (1-q)0 & = (q)3 + (1-q)6 \\
6q & = 3q + 6 - 6q \\
6q & = -3q + 6 \\
9q & = 6 \\
q & = 2/3
\end{split}
$$

What are **player 2's** expected utilities when playing either strategy?

-   $u_2( \sigma_1, L) = \sigma_1(s_T)u_2(T, L) + \sigma_1(s_B)u_2(B, L) = (p)0 + (1-p)4$

-   $u_2(\sigma_1, R) = \sigma_1(s_T)u_2(T, R) + \sigma_1(s_B)u_2(B, R) = (p)6 + (1-p)0$

For mixed strategy equilibrium to exist, by definition, players must be indifferent to both strategies:

$$
\begin{split}
u_2(\sigma_1, L) & = u_2(\sigma_1, R) \\
(p)0 + (1-p)4 & = (p)6 + (1-p)0 \\
4 - 4p & = 6p \\
10p & = 4 \\
p & = 2/5
\end{split}
$$

Thus, there is a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibria where:

$$
(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*) = \left((\frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5} ), (\frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3} ) \right)
$$

## 1c:

|     |              |              |
|-----|--------------|--------------|
|     | L            | R            |
| T   | 0, 1         | **0**, **2** |
| B   | **2**, **2** | **0**, 1     |

We can pretty quickly see there are two Nash Equilibria, one involving each player playing another strategy. Now, let us define $p$ and $q$ as the following:

-   $p$ is probability player 1 plays $T$, $1-p$ is probability plays $B$. Let us call this strategy $\sigma_1$.

-   $q$ is probability player 2 plays $L$, $1-q$ is probability plays $R$ . Let us call this strategy $\sigma_2$.

-   $\sigma_i(s_k)$ denotes the probability that player $i$ plays strategy $s_k$

What are **player 1's** expected utilities when playing either strategy?

-   $u_1 (T, \sigma_2) = \sigma_2(s_L)u_1(T, L) + \sigma_2(S_R) u_1(T, R) = (q)0 + (1-q)0$

-   $u_1 (B, \sigma_2) = \sigma_2(s_L) u_1(B,L) + \sigma_2(s_R) u_1(B,R) = (q)2 + (1-q)0$

For mixed strategy equilibrium to exist, by definition, players must be indifferent to both strategies:

$$
\begin{split}
u_1 (T, \sigma_2) & = u_1 (B, \sigma_2) \\
(q)0 + (1-q)0 & = (q)(2) + (1-q)0 \\
0 & = 2q \\
q & = 0
\end{split}
$$

What are **player 2's** expected utilities when playing either strategy?

-   $u_2( \sigma_1, L) = \sigma_1(s_T)u_2(T, L) + \sigma_1(s_B)u_2(B, L) = (p)1 + (1-p)2$

-   $u_2(\sigma_1, R) = \sigma_1(s_T)u_2(T, R) + \sigma_1(s_B)u_2(B, R) = (p)2 + (1-p)1$

For mixed strategy equilibrium to exist, by definition, players must be indifferent to both strategies:

$$
\begin{split}
u_2(\sigma_1, L) & = u_2(\sigma_1, R) \\
(p)1 + (1-p)2 & = (p)2 + (1-p)1 \\
p + 2 - 2p & = 2p + 1 - p \\
-p + 2 & = p + 1 \\
1 & = 2p \\
p & = 1/2
\end{split}
$$

Thus, there is a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibria where:

$$
(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*) = \left((\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} ), (0, 1 ) \right)
$$

## 1d:

|     |              |              |          |
|-----|--------------|--------------|----------|
|     | A2           | B2           | C2       |
| A1  | 0, 0         | **2**, **3** | **7**, 0 |
| B1  | **3**, **2** | 0, 0         | 0, 0     |
| C1  | 0, **7**     | 0, 0         | 6, 6     |

: For player 1, strategy $C^1$ is strictly dominanted. They will never play that strategy. We know that will not be a part of the mixed strategy nash equilibrium.

For player 2, strategy $C^2$ is strictly dominated. They will never play that strategy. We know that will not be a part of the mixed strategy nash equilibrium.

Thus, we can simplify the matrix to:

|     |              |              |
|-----|--------------|--------------|
|     | A2           | B2           |
| A1  | 0, 0         | **2**, **3** |
| B1  | **3**, **2** | 0, 0         |

Now, let us find the mixed strategy nash equilibriums. Let us define $p$ and $q$ as the following:

-   $p$ is probability player 1 plays $T$, $1-p$ is probability plays $B$. Let us call this strategy $\sigma_1$.

-   $q$ is probability player 2 plays $L$, $1-q$ is probability plays $R$ . Let us call this strategy $\sigma_2$.

-   $\sigma_i(s_k)$ denotes the probability that player $i$ plays strategy $s_k$

What are **player 1's** expected utilities when playing either strategy?

-   $u_1 (A^1, \sigma_2) = \sigma_2(s_{A^2})u_1(A^1, A^2) + \sigma_2(S_{B^2}) u_1(A^1, B^2) = (q)0 + (1-q)2$

-   $u_1 (B^1, \sigma_2) = \sigma_2(s_{A^2}) u_1(B^1,A^2) + \sigma_2(s_{B^2}) u_1(B^1,B^2) = (q)3 + (1-q)0$

For mixed strategy equilibrium to exist, by definition, players must be indifferent to both strategies:

$$
\begin{split}
u_1 (A^1, \sigma_2) & = u_1 (B^1, \sigma_2) \\
(q)0 + (1-q)2 & = (q)3 + (1-q)0 \\
2 - 2q & = 3q \\
2 & = 5q \\
q & = 2/5
\end{split}
$$

What are **player 2's** expected utilities when playing either strategy?

-   $u_2(\sigma_1, A^2) = \sigma_1(s_{A^1}) u_2(A^1, A^2)+ \sigma_1(s_{B^1})u_2(B^1, A^2) = (p)0 + (1-p)2$

-   $u_2(\sigma_1, B^2) = \sigma_1(s_{A^1}) u_2(A^1, B^2) + \sigma_1(s_{B^1})u_2(B^1, B^2) = (p)3 + (1-p)0$

{{< pagebreak >}}

For mixed strategy equilibrium to exist, by definition, players must be indifferent to both strategies:

$$
\begin{split}
u_2(\sigma_1 A^2) & = u_2(\sigma_1, B^2) \\
(p)0 + (1-p)2 & = (p)3 + (1-p) 0 \\
2 - 2p & = 3p \\
2 & = 5p \\
p & = 2/5
\end{split}
$$

Thus, there is a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibria where:

$$
(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*) = \left((\frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5}, 0 ), (\frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5}, 0 ) \right)
$$

Since the third strategy is strictly dominated for both so it is 0 probability.

|      |      |      |
|------|------|------|

|      |      |      |
|------|------|------|
|      | Cafe | Pub  |
| Cafe | 4, 3 | 1, 1 |
| Pub  | 0, 0 | 3, 4 |

-   **a) find all pure strategy NE**

-   **b) compute best responses to any mixed strategy of the opponent**

-   **c) display the best responses in a two dimensional graph**

-   **d) describe mutual best responses**

# Question 4

**Coordination game. Two people can perform a task if and only if they both exert effort.**

-   **They are both better off if they both exert effort and perform the task, than if neither exerts effort (and nothing is accomplished);**

-   **the worst outcome for each person is that she exerts effort and the other person does not (in which case again nothing is accomplished).**

-   **Specifically, the playersâ€™ preferences are represented by the expected value of the payoff functions below where c is a positive number less than 1 that can be interpreted as the cost of exerting effort.**

**Find all the mixed strategy Nash equilibria of this game. How do the equilibria change as c increases? Explain the reasons for the changes.**

|           |           |          |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
|           | No Effort | Effort   |
| No Effort | 0, 0      | 0, -c    |
| Effort    | -c, 0     | 1-c, 1-c |

So let us first look at the pure strategies, and see if there is any equilibria:

|           |              |                  |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
|           | No Effort    | Effort           |
| No Effort | **0**, **0** | 0, -c            |
| Effort    | -c, 0        | **1-c**, **1-c** |

So we have two pure nash strategy equilibria: (No Effort, No Effort), and (Effort, Effort). That means players can pick either strategy and are indifferent between the two.So let us find the mixed strategy nash Equilibria!:

#### Definitions

For clarity, here are the definitions I am using

-   I will define strategy *No Effort* as $N$, and Strategy *Effort* as $E$ for ease of writing equations.

-   To make it even more clear, player 1's strategies will have a subscript 1: $N_1, E_1$, while player 2's strategies will have a subscript 2: $N_2, E_2$.

Mixed strategies:

-   $p$ is the probability player 1 plays $N_1$, thus $1-p$ is probability plays $E_1$ (cuz rules of probability) Let us call this mixed strategy profile $\sigma_1$.

-   $q$ is the probability player 2 plays $N_1$, $1-q$ is probability plays $E_1$ . Let us call this mixed strategy profile $\sigma_2$.

-   $\sigma_i(s_k)$ denotes the probability that player $i$ plays strategy $s_k$. For example, $\sigma_1(N_1)$ is the probability that player 1 plays $N_1$ in the mixed strategy $\sigma_1$.

#### Player 1

Player 1's utility for playing *No Effort* $N_1$, while player 2 plays mixed strategy $\sigma_2$:

$$
\begin{split}
u_1(N_1, \sigma_2) & = \sigma_2(N_2) \times u_1(N_1, N_2) + \sigma_2(E_2) \times u_1(N_1, E_2)\\
& = q \times 0 + (1-q) \times 0 \\
& = 0
\end{split}
$$

Player 1's utility for player *Effort* $E_1$, while player 2 plays mixed strategy $\sigma_2$:

$$
\begin{split}
u_1(E_1, \sigma_2) & = \sigma_2(N_2) \times u_1 (E_1, N_2) + \sigma_2(E_2) \times u_1(E_1, E_2) \\
& = q \times (-c) + (1-q) \times (1-c) \\
& = -cq + (1-q)(1-c) \\
& = -cq + 1 -c -q +qc \\
& = 1-c-q
\end{split}
$$

Now since player 1 is indifferent between $N_1$ and $E_1$, they should have equal utility:

$$
\begin{split}
u_1(N_1, \sigma_2) &= u_1(E_1, \sigma_2) \\
0 & = 1 - c - q \\
q &= 1-c
\end{split}
$$

#### Player 2

**It is a symmetric game so in theory, the same outcome for player 2 and p.**

But let us be thorough and double check.

Player 2's utility for playing *No Effort* $N_2$, while player 1 plays mixed strategy $\sigma_1$:

$$
\begin{split}
u_2(\sigma_1, N_2) & = \sigma_1(N_1) \times u_2(N_1, N_2) + \sigma_1(E_1) \times u_2(E_1, N_2) \\
& = p \times 0 + (1-p) \times 0 \\
& = 0
\end{split}
$$

Player 2's utility for player *Effort* $E_2$, while player 1 plays mixed strategy $\sigma_1$:

$$
\begin{split}
u_2(\sigma_1, E_2) & = \sigma_1(N_1) \times u_2(N_1, E_2) + \sigma_1(E_1) \times u_2(E_1, E_2) \\
& = p \times (-c) + (1-p) \times (1-c) \\
& = -pc + (1-p)(1-c) \\
& = -pc + 1 - p - c + pc \\
& = 1 - p - c
\end{split}
$$

Now since player 2 is indifferent between $N_2$ and $E_2$, they should have equal utility:

$$
\begin{split}
u_2(\sigma_1, N_2) & = u_2(\sigma_1, E_2) \\
0 & = 1 - p - c \\
p & = 1- c
\end{split}
$$

#### Conclusion

Thus, $q = 1-c$ and $p = 1-c$ as we have shown above.

-   So, $1-q = 1 - (1-c) = c$, and $1-p = 1-(1-c) = c$.

**Thus, the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium of this game is** $(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*) = ((1-c, c), (1-c, c))$

OK so what does that mean?

-   As $c$ becomes larger, $q$ and $p$ decrease.

-   $q$ and $p$ represent the probabilities that a player will play No effort within the mixed strategy $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$.

-   So in context of this game, as the cost of exerting effort increases, the probability a player will play *No Effot* will decrease.
