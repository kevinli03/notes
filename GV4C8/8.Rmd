# **Incomplete Information**

### Introduction

We will introduce the possibility of not observing what other players have done in past rounds

-   And the possibility of not knowing opponents' motivations or preferences

Thus, this is incomplete information:

-   Players will have an initial belief on information (prior)

```{=html}

```
-   We will need to introduce a way to update beliefs when new information is available.
